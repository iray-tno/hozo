// the same division `@hozo/vite` uses on Web, where it runs
// `enforce: 'pre'` ahead of the React plugin. And the candidate module is
// generated at config time: a `className` the compiler can't read at build
// time is resolved on device from a project-wide map, and that map has to
// exist before the bundle starts.

// Expo, or another tool as the upstream handoff.
// `sources` is narrowed to `@hozo/core` here, and this example is the one
// place that should be. Hozo compiles `react-native` imports by default --
// that is how an existing Expo app gets the compiler without a rewrite --
// but `NativeBench.tsx` exists to be the hand-written React Native the
// bundle benchmark measures Hozo *against*. Compiled, it stops being a
// baseline, and the increment silently becomes Hozo-versus-Hozo.
