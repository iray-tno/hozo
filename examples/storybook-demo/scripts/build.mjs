// Runs the Storybook build, and survives a teardown crash that has nothing
// to do with the build.
//
// Three runs in eight, on Windows, this exits 0xC0000409 *after* writing
// every artifact correctly -- on a libuv assertion,
// `!(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)` in `src\win\async.c`, which is
// `uv_async_send` reaching a handle the loop has already begun closing.
// The build is finished by then; `check-build.mjs` passes on the output of
// a crashed run. Nothing in Hozo is on that path -- the crash is between
// Node and the worker threads Storybook's bundler leaves behind.
//
// So the exit code stops being the judge and the artifacts start, which is
// the same rule `check-build.mjs` was written under: prove the build did
// its job rather than that it exited zero. A genuine failure still fails,
// because the output directory is removed first and the check runs
// against whatever is actually there afterwards.
//
// Narrow on purpose: only this exit code, only on Windows. Any other
// failure is reported as-is.
