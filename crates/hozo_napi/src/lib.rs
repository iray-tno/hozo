//! napi-rs bindings exposing the Hozo compiler to Node-based build tooling.
//!
//! First pass: proves the Rust<->JS bridge itself works (the actual
//! foundational bet from the design discussion, untested until now) by
//! exposing the same `hozo_parser::parse_tsx` -> `hozo_web::lower`
//! pipeline already validated in `hozo_web`'s tests/example, as a
//! synchronous Node-callable function. This is not yet the shape
//! `@hozo/vite` will actually want (full rendered HTML rather than
//! source-rewrite instructions) -- that comes once the plugin itself is
//! being wired up and its real requirements are known.
