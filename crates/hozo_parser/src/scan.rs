//! Finds Tailwind-class-looking strings anywhere in a source file.
//!
//! This is deliberately *imprecise*, and that's the point. Everywhere else
//! Hozo reads `className` exactly, from the JSX AST -- which is why it can
//! compile those away completely. The cost of that precision is that it
//! can't see a class it never reads, so `className={getDynamic()}` has no
//! CSS behind it (proposal §7's third tier).
//!
//! Scanning is what closes that gap, and it's how Tailwind itself works:
//! its `oxide` crate byte-scans source files for candidate strings rather
//! than understanding the code. A candidate found here isn't known to be
//! used -- `getDynamic()` might never return it -- so this only feeds the
//! fallback path, never the precise one. False positives cost unused CSS
//! rules; a missed candidate costs a silently unstyled element, so the
//! scan errs toward including too much.
//!
//! With one subtraction: ranges the compiler *did* read exactly are
//! skipped. Without that, `className="p-4"` would both compile into a
//! scoped rule and reappear as `.p-4` in the candidate stylesheet -- which
//! would grow with the app's entire static utility surface and give back
//! the bloat precise reading exists to avoid. The subtraction is
//! per-occurrence, not global: the same class written statically in one
//! file and produced dynamically in another is still covered by the
//! second file's scan.
