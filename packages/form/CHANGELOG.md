# @hozo/form

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#821](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/821) [`ad1ad0b`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/ad1ad0b355c6ecae07372f44a65aed279e539e22) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `FileDropzone`. It is a button that opens the file picker, with dropping files on it as a shortcut on the Web. Every pick is sorted by `accept`, the size limits and the count, and what was added and what was refused (with each reason) is announced in one sentence. On React Native it opens the application's `pickFiles`, or `expo-document-picker` when installed. With neither, it is disabled and says no picker is available.

  - @hozo/behaviors@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

- Introduce Calendar, DatePicker, DateRangePicker, TimePicker and DateTimePicker, including range selection, controlled month, locale-aware formatting and shared date/time arithmetic.
- Add Form submission/invalid-control coordination and TextArea sizing/count feedback.
- Add NativeSelect: browser select, iOS ActionSheet, modal-list fallback and an application-injected Native presenter.
- Include Web keyboard, virtual/real-reader and Native accessibility evidence. The unstyled controls still require application styling or the styled UI layer.
