# @hozo/form

Accessible universal form and date-selection components for Hozo.

A separate package rather than part of [`@hozo/patterns`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hozo/patterns), for two reasons that are specific to this domain. Its platform-native variants reach for the operating system's own pickers — `UIDatePicker` on iOS, Material's `DatePickerDialog` on Android, the iOS wheel picker behind a select — which is an optional dependency on native code that an application using only Tabs and Tree should not acquire. And its locale and calendar data changes on a schedule of its own, which a stable widget package should not be versioned against.

## What is here today

The date arithmetic a calendar grid is built out of, with no `Date` in its types and no rendering yet:

```ts
import { firstDayOfWeek, monthGrid, moveFocus } from '@hozo/form'

const first = firstDayOfWeek('ja-JP') // 0, Sunday
const weeks = monthGrid({ year: 2026, month: 9, firstDayOfWeek: first })

// Arrow keys, Home/End, and PageUp/PageDown over an unbounded domain.
moveFocus({ year: 2026, month: 9, day: 29 }, 'ArrowDown') // 2026-10-06
```

`CalendarDate` is a plain `{ year, month, day }` record with `month` numbered 1-12. A month grid is made of *civil* dates, and `Date` is an instant on a timeline: building one from local parts shifts across DST and timezone boundaries, which is how a grid ends up drawing the first of the month twice, or losing the last day of it, for users east of UTC. Every calculation here goes through UTC internally, where a day is always the same length.

`moveFocus` returns `null` for a key the grid does not own and the date unchanged for a move it refuses, so a component can tell "let the event through" apart from "handled, and `preventDefault` is still owed".

## Why the week data is a table

`Intl.Locale.prototype.getWeekInfo` would say which day a locale's week starts on. It is a later addition to ECMA-402, and Hermes ships only `Collator`, `DateTimeFormat` and `NumberFormat` — the same wall [`@hozo/canvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hozo/canvas) met with `Intl.Segmenter`. A lookup that worked on the Web and guessed on a phone would mean the same month drawn two ways, so `firstDayOfWeek` is a deterministic table instead, identical on both platforms, with a prop to override it.

Month and weekday *names* are a different matter: `Intl.DateTimeFormat` does exist on both, so nothing here hand-rolls those.

## Status

Design is recorded in [#148](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/issues/148). The rendered `Calendar`, `DatePicker`, `TimePicker` and `DateRangePicker` compose [`@hozo/behaviors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hozo/behaviors) and land on top of this module.
