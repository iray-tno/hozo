// The React Native half of Hozo's Dialog (proposal §10.3).
//
// Same shape as the Web one and the same posture: delegate. React Native's
// `Modal` is the platform's modal, and `accessibilityViewIsModal` is what
// tells VoiceOver and TalkBack that everything behind it is out of scope --
// the equivalent of the top layer making the page inert. Reimplementing
// either would mean fighting the OS accessibility tree from JavaScript,
// which is the emulation the proposal's principle warns off.
//
// Two differences from Web that are the platform, not the port:
//
// - Escape is Android's hardware back button, which arrives as
//   `onRequestClose`. React Native requires that prop on Android and warns
//   without it, for the same reason the Web side treats `onClose` as
//   effectively required: a modal you cannot dismiss reads as a trap.
// - Focus restoration is the OS's. React Native has no
//   `document.activeElement` to capture and nothing to give focus back to,
//   so `./focus.ts`'s restore rule has no work here -- the screen reader
//   returns to where it was when the modal is dismissed.
