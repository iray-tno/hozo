// The only thing Hozo ships to a device, and it exists for exactly one
// reason: React Native has no CSS engine.
//
// On Web, a `className` the compiler couldn't read needs no runtime at all
// -- the class string reaches the DOM, and the browser matches it against
// the generated candidate stylesheet by itself. Native has nothing to hand
// the string to, so this closes that one gap and nothing else.
//
// One exception, added later: a `<div role="button">` that Hozo put in the
// tab order needs Enter and Space wired up, and only script can do that.
// See `./activate.ts`.
//
// Compare `react-native-css`, which implements a genuine CSS engine in JS:
// specificity sorting, media/container query evaluation, CSS variables, a
// reactive observable graph. It needs all of that because it accepts
// arbitrary CSS. This resolver handles only *single Tailwind utility
// classes*, which are all the same specificity -- so "later in the string
// wins" is the entire cascade, and React Native's own style-array merging
// already implements that. Hence a lookup, not an engine.
