# @hozo/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`80f2686`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/80f2686ace0922e27502695d0b88c1dba2e08be0) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `Avatar`: a person's picture, or their initials when it is absent or fails to load, read as one image named for the person, with an optional status read after the name ("Ada Lovelace, online"). The headless version lives in `@hozo/patterns`, and the look (three sizes and a status dot) in `@hozo/ui`. Its class lists compile on both platforms, as `Chip`'s do. `@hozo/core` now also exports `Chip`, which it previously reached only through compiled output.

- [#818](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/818) [`adfe1fd`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/adfe1fd914d60effc27677efdaee6edf19feaf6b) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `ColorPicker`. It offers:
  - preset swatches as a radio group;
  - hue, saturation and lightness (and opacity, with `alpha`) as ordinary sliders rather than a two-dimensional square, which a keyboard and a screen reader can reach but not operate;
  - a hex field;
  - on the Web, an optional eyedropper where the browser has one.
  
  Every colour is read named and numbered, for example "dark blue, #1e3a8a", and the names go through the i18n connection. `Slider` on the Web now also takes a track `style`.

- [#817](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/817) [`496f1b7`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/496f1b75e06bc5f5b079870ce566754e7161c21a) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `CommandPalette` and `useCommandShortcut`.
  
  **`CommandPalette`** is a searchable list of commands in a modal.
  - On the Web it is a dialog holding a combobox and a grouped listbox. The arrow keys move through the matching commands while focus stays in the field (`aria-activedescendant`), Enter runs one, and Escape closes it and returns focus.
  - On React Native it is a full-screen modal with a button per command.
  - On both platforms, matches are ranked (starts with, then a word that starts with, then contains, then the letters in order), and the number of matches is announced as the query narrows them.
  - The headless version lives in `@hozo/patterns` and the look in `@hozo/ui`.
  
  **`useCommandShortcut`** (`@hozo/behaviors`) calls a function for ⌘K on a Mac and Ctrl+K elsewhere. It does nothing on React Native.

- [#809](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/809) [`70cc763`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/70cc763166d3f3aa04c466c5a12e7a8a4dba0a0f) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `OtpInput`, for a one-time code or a PIN. It is one real input drawn as cells, so a screen reader finds one field ("Verification code, 6 characters"), and a pasted or autofilled code lands at once. It asks each platform for a one-time code: `autocomplete="one-time-code"` on the Web, `textContentType="oneTimeCode"` on iOS and `autoComplete="sms-otp"` on Android. `mask` turns it into a PIN. The active and filled cells are styled by class lists the pattern applies, so the look reaches React Native as well.

- [#797](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/797) [`9a33076`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/9a3307689c1a37847d45bea9083cee1f63c7edba) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `Pagination`: numbered pages with previous and next, inside a `<nav>` named "Pagination". The current page is marked with `aria-current="page"` (`selected` on Native), and the ends are disabled in place rather than removed. With `getPageHref` every page is a link, which on Native goes through the installed router. The current page and the disabled ends are styled by class lists the pattern applies (`currentItemClassName`, `disabledItemClassName`), so the same look reaches React Native, where there are no selectors.

- [#798](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/798) [`030d179`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/030d1791515ef5523560c38c1788e4b23f6bfd92) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `Stepper`: where a person is in a process of several steps. Each step is read with its position and status in words ("Step 2 of 3: Profile, current"), so the status is never carried by colour alone. The current step is marked `aria-current="step"` on the Web and `selected` on Native. With `onStepPress` the steps are buttons. Each status has class lists for the step and its indicator, applied by the pattern, so the look reaches React Native as well.

- [#800](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/800) [`18a0e93`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/18a0e93cac8a778ca919c23d0ccfe7a65c506ef6) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Add `Table`, `TableCaption`, `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, `TableFooter`, `TableRow`, `TableHead` and `TableCell`.
  
  - **Web:** they are the table elements themselves, and a header cell is `scope="col"` unless the author says otherwise.
  - **React Native,** which has no table:
    - Each column is as wide as its widest cell, the way the browser's automatic table layout does it. A table is shrink-to-fit by default, shares out the spare room in proportion with `w-full`, shrinks its columns to fit when too wide, or scrolls sideways with `scrollable`.
    - A data cell is read with its column's header ("Price, $12").
    - Each cell carries its row and column for TalkBack.

### Patch Changes

- [#795](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/795) [`8e110be`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/8e110be92d0ea8d435ecd1f5e7dcfb236b00b368) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - `Chip`'s `className` and `removeClassName` now style it on React Native. Before, both were ignored there. The compiler lowers `Chip` from `@hozo/core` to `HozoChip` and hands its two class lists over as `style` and `removeStyle`. On the Web they are compiled to classes as before. The Native pattern moves text styles such as `text-white` onto its label, where a `Text` can draw them.

- [#794](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/794) [`42d0e77`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/42d0e7772061d498b1bc2a1ae170cea93607ba10) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - `Meter` now draws its bar on React Native: a track, a fill as wide as the amount, and the fill coloured by `low`, `high` and `optimum` the way Chrome colours `<meter>`. Before, Native rendered an empty 80 x 16 box. The author's `className` styles the track. The compiled and uncompiled paths are now one component, `HozoMeter`.

## 0.2.0

- Keep the existing facade API and upgrade its primitive, pattern, typography, semantic and SVG owners together.
- Existing re-exported primitives benefit from React 19 ref-prop fixes and owner-package motion/accessibility repairs. Import newly added patterns and form/UI domains from their own packages; this release does not add every new widget to the facade.

See the [Hozo release notes and migration steps](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#020) for cross-package changes and measured boundaries.
