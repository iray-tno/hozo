// The fallbacks' accessibility props, rendered rather than read.
//
// This exists because of a bug that lived here unnoticed: ScrollView and
// FlatList wrote `aria-label`, `aria-description` and `aria-busy` and then
// spread `universalDomProps(...)` *after* them. That helper names all
// three unconditionally, and both components destructure
// `accessibilityLabel`/`accessibilityHint` out of the props it receives --
// so it named them `undefined`, and the later spread erased what the
// component had just set. A ScrollView given an `accessibilityLabel`
// rendered without one.
//
// Nothing caught it. There were no tests over these components at all, and
// the repository had never been type-checked; the first `tsc` run reported
// all six as "specified more than once, so this usage will be
// overwritten". So the test here is the general one -- every primitive
// that accepts an accessibility prop must put it in the markup -- rather
// than a narrow assertion about spread order, which is an implementation
// detail that could be got wrong again some other way.
