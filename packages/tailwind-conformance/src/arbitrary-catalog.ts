// A denominator for Tailwind's arbitrary syntax, derived rather than
// chosen.
//
// The named catalogue could be enumerated because Tailwind's own
// `getClassList()` enumerates it. Arbitrary values can't be: there are
// infinitely many, which is exactly why the 100% Web figure never covered
// any of them -- the whole syntax sat outside the measurement, and the one
// bug class it hid (a font size compiled as a colour) was invisible for
// precisely that reason.
//
// So the list is built by asking Tailwind, not by picking favourites. Every
// prefix that appears anywhere in the real catalogue is crossed with a
// fixed set of representative values, and whatever Tailwind emits a rule
// for is what Hozo is then held to. Neither half is ours to choose: the
// prefixes come from Tailwind's class list and the verdict comes from
// Tailwind's compiler.
