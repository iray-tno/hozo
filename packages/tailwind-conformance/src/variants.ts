// A denominator for variants, including stacked ones -- and the only
// section that compares *where* a rule applies rather than only what it
// sets.
//
// Two gaps meet here, and they hid each other. Tailwind's `getClassList()`
// enumerates utilities and not the variants in front of them, so no
// derived denominator contains `md:hover:flex`. And every comparison in
// this package matches declaration text, so a rule that lost its `@media`
// wrapper reads as identical to one that kept it. Between the two,
// `md:hover:bg-blue-500` compiled to nothing at all -- for a class people
// write every day -- and nothing in this repository could have said so.
//
// So this section builds the combinations itself and checks three things:
// the declarations, the selector the rule matches, and the at-rules around
// it. The last two are the ones nothing else looks at.
