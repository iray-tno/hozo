// Audits Hozo's Native refusals against React Native's own type surface.
//
// `unsupported_on_native()` refuses thousands of utilities, and until now
// every one of those refusals was unchecked: Hozo decided what React Native
// can't do, and then Hozo's report counted its own decisions as the
// denominator. A wrong refusal is invisible that way -- it removes a utility
// from the numerator *and* the denominator at once, so the percentage never
// moves and nothing ever points at it.
//
// The check is the same move the full Tailwind catalogue made on the Web
// side: ask the other tool to enumerate itself. For each refused utility,
// take the CSS Tailwind says it produces, and ask React Native's `.d.ts`
// whether it could hold that. If it could, the refusal is suspect and wants
// a human read.
//
// A suspect verdict is not proof of a bug. React Native's types are a
// necessary condition, not a sufficient one -- `filter` is typed but only
// some functions are implemented, and a native style key can exist while
// doing nothing on one platform. Suspect means "this refusal is a claim we
// can no longer support from the types alone", which is exactly the set
// worth reading.
