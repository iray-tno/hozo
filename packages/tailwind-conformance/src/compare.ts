// Compares one utility's Hozo output against the Tailwind oracle's,

//
//   UNSUPPORTED      -- Hozo emits nothing. A coverage gap, not a bug.
//   MISMATCH         -- both emit, and they disagree. A fidelity bug.
//   SKIPPED          -- the normalizer couldn't resolve one side
//                       confidently, so no claim is made either way.
//   COMPOSITION_ONLY -- Tailwind itself paints nothing standalone, so a
//                       one-utility comparison can't measure it at all.
//                       Not a gap: emitting nothing *is* the right answer
//                       here, and it leaves the denominator for the same
//                       reason the candidates Tailwind emits no rule for do.

 *
 * - `no-rule` is Tailwind's decision and nothing to do with Hozo.
 * - `expected-unresolvable` is a value only a browser can reduce -- a

 *   it is where a real defect hid: `ring-[calc(100%-2rem)]` compiled to
 *   nothing on Web while Tailwind painted a ring, and this section said
 *   nothing because it had stopped looking one step earlier.
 * - `actual-unresolvable` is the uncomfortable one: Hozo emitted something
 *   the normalizer could not reduce, so the comparison gave up on output
 *   this project controls.
