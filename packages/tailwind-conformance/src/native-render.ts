// Runs the Native backend's output.
//
// What this establishes, and what it doesn't, is worth being exact about.
// React Native ships Flow-typed JavaScript that Node can't parse, so the
// real `react-native` is not importable here and this renders against a
// stub. So it does **not** prove that React Native's runtime accepts the
// output -- only a device or a simulator does that.
//
// What it does prove is the part nothing else touches: that the generated
// module parses and evaluates, that the tree it builds has the styles and
// props on the components they were meant for, and that Hozo's own runtime
// components behave -- `HozoSpaced` distributing a parent's `space-*` over
// children, `HozoDialog` opening. Those are ordinary React, and until now
// they had never run.
//
// It pairs with the type check, which asks React Native's own declarations
// whether each emitted style is one it would accept. Types say the styles
// are valid; this says the tree is assembled correctly.
