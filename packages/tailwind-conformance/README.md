# @hozo/tailwind-conformance

Differential test against the real Tailwind engine. For each candidate utility it compiles the class both ways — through the actual `tailwindcss` package and through Hozo — and compares the results.

## Two denominators

It measures against two lists, and they say different things.

**Curated** (`candidates.ts`, 120 utilities) — a hand-picked slice of what real app code uses. Good for "does the common path work", useless as a claim about Tailwind coverage: we chose it, and we chose it knowing what Hozo implements.

**Full catalogue** (`catalog.ts`) — every class Tailwind's own design system can generate, asked for through `__unstable__loadDesignSystem().getClassList()`, the entry point the official IntelliSense extension uses. Nothing in it is our choice. Entries Tailwind itself produces no standalone CSS for (a gradient stop with no gradient, a negative form of something that takes none) leave the denominator, and Tailwind decides that too.

## StyleX property surface

The report also measures the experimental StyleX frontend against StyleX's
published `CSSProperties` declaration. It prints both the complete CSS
property-name denominator and its intersection with React Native's published
style keys. The numerator is read from the Rust frontend's lowering arms, so a
new mapping cannot be added without moving the snapshot.

This is intentionally called a **property-name upper bound**. One mapped name
does not imply every value is accepted, and it says nothing about StyleX APIs
such as themes, variables, keyframes, nested conditions, or cross-file sheets.

Read the full percentage with its shape in mind: value expansion dominates it. `mask-*` alone is over a quarter of the catalogue, and covering `bg-blue-500` and `bg-blue-600` is one code path counted twice. The per-namespace table is the actionable view — which families Hozo handles, which it doesn't, and where it emits something *wrong*.

## Sections

The report has three sections, measuring different things:

**Web** — coverage *and* fidelity, because Tailwind is the oracle.

**Native** — coverage only. Tailwind exists as CSS, so it can't say what `p-4` "should" be in React Native; there's nothing to diff against. What it can measure is what Hozo does with each utility, split three ways:

| | meaning |
|---|---|
| `COVERED` | lowers to a real RN style — or prop, since RN expresses some CSS concepts that way |
| `REFUSED` | raises a build-stopping error naming the utility — a known gap |
| `SILENT` | compiles to nothing, and nothing says so |

Each candidate is tried on both `View` and `Text` and counts as covered if either works, because whether a utility lowers can depend on the primitive: truncation becomes `numberOfLines`, which only exists on `Text`. The question being answered is "can this be used on Native at all", not "does it work on a View".

That rule would hide something on its own, so anything covered on some primitives but not others is also listed separately as **restricted**. Writing one of those on the wrong element is still a build error, and a bare coverage number would quietly imply otherwise.

That third category is the point of the split. A refusal is a supportable answer; disappearing quietly is the failure mode this project keeps trying to avoid, so the two aren't lumped together as "unsupported". A `SILENT` entry isn't automatically a bug — `whitespace-normal` is one, because RN's Text already wraps — but each one should be a decision someone made, not an oversight.

A refusal outranks partial output: `truncate`'s `overflow` lowers fine while its `text-overflow` can't, and since the error stops the build, calling it "covered" would claim a build that actually fails.

Because Web fidelity is measured against Tailwind alone, a React Native limitation is never a valid reason to accept a Web mismatch — Native isn't what that section measures.

```
pnpm --filter @hozo/compiler build:native   # the report needs the native addon
pnpm --filter @hozo/tailwind-conformance report
pnpm --filter @hozo/tailwind-conformance test   # the normalizer's own tests
```

## The two numbers

- **Coverage** — of the candidates Tailwind produces a rule for, how many Hozo emits *something* for. A gap here is unimplemented surface, not a bug.
- **Fidelity** — of those, how many match Tailwind's meaning exactly. A gap here *is* a bug: the class is accepted but compiles to the wrong thing, which is worse than not supporting it.

Both are measured against `src/candidates.ts` — a representative slice of what real app code uses, not all of Tailwind (which is unbounded once arbitrary values count). The denominator is a judgement call, so the number is only meaningful alongside that list.

## Why a normalizer

The two sides constantly differ without disagreeing:

| Tailwind | Hozo |
|---|---|
| `flex: 1` | `flex: 1 1 0%` |
| `padding: calc(var(--spacing) * 4)` | four `padding-*: 16px` longhands |
| `background-color: var(--color-blue-500)` | `background-color: oklch(…)` |
| `line-height: calc(1.75 / 1.25)` | `line-height: 28px` |

So `normalize.ts` resolves custom properties, folds `calc()`, converts rem→px, expands shorthands to longhands, and canonicalizes value spelling — then the two are compared as declaration maps.

**It refuses to guess.** Anything it can't confidently resolve is reported `SKIPPED` rather than counted as a match or a mismatch, because a normalizer that quietly mis-resolves would manufacture both. `normalize.test.ts` pins that behavior directly; it's the load-bearing part of the whole comparison, and if it's wrong every number here is wrong.

## Verdicts

| | meaning |
|---|---|
| `MATCH` | normalized declarations are identical |
| `MISMATCH` | both emit, and they disagree — a fidelity bug |
| `UNSUPPORTED` | Hozo emits nothing — a coverage gap |
| `SKIPPED` | one side couldn't be normalized; no claim made |

`compare.ts` also has an accepted-differences list for deliberate, permanent divergences. It's currently empty, and the bar for adding to it is high: its one former entry (`rounded-full`) turned out to be excused by a Native constraint in a Web-only comparison, which is exactly the kind of reasoning an allowlist makes easy to smuggle in. The fix was to model the difference properly — `Radius::Full` lets Web emit Tailwind's exact `calc(infinity * 1px)` while Native falls back to a finite value — not to keep waving it through.
