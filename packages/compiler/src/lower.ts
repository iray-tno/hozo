// It lived inside `@hozo/vite`'s `transform` until Next.js needed the same
// hundred lines. What is actually bundler-specific turns out to be small --
// where diagnostics go, when files are written, how a companion stylesheet
// is referenced -- and everything else is the same work: compile the
// module, splice each component back at the span the Rust side reported,
// namespace the class names so two components in one file can't collide,
// and decide whether the `@hozo/core` import may go.
//
// Splitting it here rather than having Next import the Vite plugin keeps
// the dependency honest: a Next.js project has no Vite in it.

 * *deleted*. Now that they're carried, anything the compiler couldn't lower
 * in place survives to the output, and the import is what makes it resolve.
 *
 * Deliberately a word match rather than a `<Tag` match, and deliberately
 * biased toward keeping the import. A primitive can be referenced without
 * ever appearing as a tag (`const Label = Text` then `<Label/>`), and the
 * two failure modes are not symmetric: an unnecessary import is dead weight
 * a bundler drops, while a missing one breaks at runtime. On Web it doesn't
 * even break cleanly -- `Text` is a DOM global (the text-node interface),
 * so React is handed a DOM class where a component belongs and throws
 * something unrelated to the cause. `View` at least gives an honest
 * ReferenceError.
 *
 * The bias goes all the way: the import statement is part of the text this
 * searches, so in practice it always finds a primitive and the import
 * always survives. What actually removes it is the bundler's own
 * unused-specifier elision, once lowering has left nothing referring to it
 * -- which is the same outcome by a route that cannot be wrong. This
 * remains as the check that would keep a *used* one, and it is the reason
 * `PanResponder.create(...)` beside a lowered tree still resolves.
