// One policy for what a diagnostic does, shared by every integration.
//
// It was four policies. Metro threw on an error-severity diagnostic and
// warned otherwise; Vite and Next warned on everything, including errors.
// That difference read as deliberate -- Native has cases with no correct
// output, Web mostly doesn't -- but it was not: every error-severity
// diagnostic Hozo can emit today happens to come from the Native backend,
// so the Web integrations had simply never been handed one. The first Web
// error added would have been printed as a warning and shipped.
//
// So the policy lives here instead, once, and says the same thing whichever
// bundler is asking. Today it changes no behaviour, which is the point of
// doing it now rather than after something depends on the gap.
