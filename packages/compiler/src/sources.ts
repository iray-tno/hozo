// Which modules a project's primitives may come from.
//
// The compiler matches on the JSX tag name and never asks where the name
// was imported from. That is deliberate and it is what makes proposal §2.1
// true -- an existing React Native file compiles as written, with no
// migration to a Hozo-specific API:
//
//     import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
//
// It is also, unguarded, a way to be badly wrong. A `<View>` from some
// other component library has its own props, its own layout, and its own
// idea of what it renders, and lowering it to a `<div>` because the tag
// happens to be spelled `View` would silently replace someone's component
// with something else.
//
// So the list travels into the compiler, which resolves each tag against
// the module its binding came from. A tag from a module the project does
// not trust is carried verbatim -- the same treatment any component Hozo
// does not model already gets -- and the tree around it still compiles.
//
// Per tag rather than per file, and that is the whole of `@expo/ui`
// support. A real Expo app writes `<View className="p-4">` from
// `react-native` and `<Button label="Save">` from `@expo/ui` in one tree,
// and `@expo/ui` exports `Text`, `Button`, `List`, `ListItem`,
// `ScrollView` and `TextInput` -- every one a native platform component
// sharing nothing with the Hozo primitive but its spelling. Refusing the
// file would leave the half Hozo understands uncompiled; accepting it
// would replace a SwiftUI button with a `<div>`.
//
// The integrations all defaulted to `@hozo/core` only, by way of a
// `code.includes('@hozo/core')` substring test. That skipped every Expo and
// React Native project on the grounds that they had not been rewritten.
