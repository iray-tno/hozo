//
// Every example verifies a *build*: one pass, one theme load, one project
// scan, exit. Dev is a different program -- it stays up, the project
// changes underneath it, and the parts that handle that (`watchChange`,
// the per-transform rescan, the candidate-stylesheet invalidation) had no
// coverage at all. Code that only ever type-checks is the failure mode
// this repository keeps finding.
//
// A real `createServer`, not a mock: what is under test is the plugin's
// agreement with Vite, and a mock would be a copy of my belief about it.
