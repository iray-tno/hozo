// Web bundler integration (proposal §A: Vite before Metro). Splices
// hozo_web's compiled JSX directly into the original source at the exact
// span the Rust side reported, rather than replacing the whole file --
// that's what lets a component keep its own hooks/handlers/other logic
// untouched while only its View/Text/Pressable/Button usage gets lowered.
//
// CSS is written to a real `<file>.hozo.css` companion file next to the
// source and imported normally, rather than served through a Vite virtual
// module -- simpler and more robust for this pass than fighting Vite's
// virtual-module CSS-type detection; a real cache directory or virtual
// module is a reasonable thing to move to once this needs to survive
// production builds cleanly.
//
// One consequence, measured against a running dev server rather than
// reasoned about: the companion stylesheet is written *during* the source
// module's transform, so a style-only edit reaches the browser in two
// rounds. The `.tsx` change triggers the first, that transform writes the
// CSS, and the watcher seeing the new CSS triggers the second. It
// converges because `writeFileIfChanged` refuses to rewrite identical
// bytes -- without that, each transform would invalidate the stylesheet it
// had just written and the two would take turns forever.
//
// Alongside that, one project-wide stylesheet covers the classes the
// compiler *couldn't* read (proposal §7's third tier). Those come from a
// byte scan of every source file rather than from the AST, so this plugin
// owns the project walk and the file-deletion signal, while the cache in
// Rust owns scanning, staleness, and persistence.

 * wrong number of pixels. The theme is read once at `buildStart` rather
 * than per file: it is a project-wide fact, and re-reading it for every
