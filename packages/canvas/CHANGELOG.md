### Patch Changes

- [#923](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/pull/923) [`8d58223`](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/commit/8d5822322607b6214fa7f57d233a9173a45815b6) Thanks [@iray-tno](https://github.com/iray-tno)! - Uncompiled View, Text and Image forward refs to their platform hosts. Container measurement preserves the host instead of replacing it, and Web View layout defaults agree between compiled output and fallback components.
  
  An uncompiled Svg now uses its accessibility label as its name, as the compiled path already did. Web controls, including generated Canvas controls and form/pattern actions, show the shared clickable cursor without giving disabled controls an active pointer.

  - @hozo/engine@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

- Add portable triangle meshes with interpolated vertex colours/alpha and affine colour textures. Preserve per-axis clamp, repeat and mirrored wrapping, and multiply texture tints in linear RGB.
- Expand Android touch/TalkBack acceptance and portable Three scene evidence through the same Canvas boundary. Interpolation/sampling remains the documented portable approximation, not GPU pixel parity.

See the [Hozo release notes and migration steps](https://github.com/iray-tno/hozo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#020) for cross-package changes and measured boundaries.
