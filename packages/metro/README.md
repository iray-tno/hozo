# @hozo/metro

Metro integration for Hozo's React Native backend. Lowers `View`/`Text`/`Pressable`/`Button` from `@hozo/core` into real React Native primitives plus a `StyleSheet.create({...})`, rewriting each component in place.

The integration is exercised by development and minified production Metro bundles. Physical-device validation is still pending.

## Setup

`metro.config.js`:

```js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config') // or '@react-native/metro-config'
const { withHozo } = require('@hozo/metro/config')

const projectRoot = __dirname
const config = getDefaultConfig(projectRoot)
module.exports = withHozo(config, { root: projectRoot })
```

Metro accepts a promised config, so `withHozo` can resolve the Tailwind theme and generate the dynamic candidate module before bundling begins. It preserves the supplied config and records an existing Babel transformer as its upstream, including Expo's or another tool's transformer.

## TypeScript

Nothing to configure, as long as the project's `tsconfig.json` extends `expo/tsconfig.base` or `@react-native/typescript-config`. Both set:

```json
{ "compilerOptions": { "moduleResolution": "bundler", "customConditions": ["react-native"] } }
```

which is what makes `tsc` resolve the same entry point Metro does. Every Hozo package publishes two — `index.js` and `index.native.js` — behind a `react-native` export condition, and TypeScript matches that condition only when it is named. A hand-written `tsconfig.json` that extends neither preset has to say it itself; `customConditions` requires `moduleResolution` to be `bundler`, `node16` or `nodenext`.

Without it, an app is type-checked against the **Web** declarations: a native-only export such as `HozoPressable` reads as missing, and a component whose two halves differ is checked against the wrong half. It still bundles and runs correctly — this is the type layer only — which is why it goes unnoticed.

## What the generated candidate module is for

A `className` Hozo can't read statically — `<View className={getVariant()} />` — still has to produce styles. On Web that's free: the class string reaches the DOM and the browser matches it against a generated stylesheet. React Native has no CSS engine, so the string has to be resolved on device.

`withHozo` scans the project for class-shaped strings and writes `node_modules/.hozo/candidates.native.js`: a class-name → style-object map plus a resolver bound to it (from `@hozo/runtime`). Files with an unreadable `className` import it; files without one don't. The same module carries the resolved `preflight` choice to Native fallback components, so an uncompiled `Heading`, `Separator`, `Small`, `Sub`, or `Sup` uses the same browser defaults as compiled code. Metro redirects `@hozo/runtime/project` automatically; no provider or application import is required. The lower-level `generateCandidateModule` API remains available from `@hozo/metro/project`.

It runs at config load rather than inside the transformer because Metro transforms in `jest-worker` subprocesses. Scanning there would mean several processes writing one cache file; the config layer is ordinary main-process code, so there's exactly one writer.

**Limitation:** the module is generated once, at config load. A class that only becomes a candidate *after* Metro started — a new string literal in a helper module — needs a Metro restart to appear. (`react-native-css` documents the same restriction for its transformer.)

**Limitation:** only unconditional utilities survive *this* path (the runtime-resolved one). A style object can't express `hover:`, `md:`, or `pressed:`, and making it able to would mean per-component state tracking — a runtime CSS engine, which Hozo deliberately doesn't ship. Those classes are recorded with the reason and warned about *when they're actually used*, not at build time: appearing in the scan doesn't prove any expression ever produces one. Write them as a static `className` and they compile to a real style variant with no runtime involved.

## `dark:` and breakpoints need a component function

Written as a static `className`, `dark:` and `sm:`/`md:`/`lg:`/`xl:`/`2xl:` compile to a React hook from `@hozo/runtime`, spliced as a statement at the top of the enclosing component:

```jsx
export function Card() {
  const __hozoDark = useHozoDark()
  return <View style={[styles.hozo_r0_0, __hozoDark && styles.hozo_r0_0_dark]} />
}
```

The hook has to be a statement. Inlining the call into the JSX (`style={[a, useHozoDark() && b]}`) breaks the rules of hooks as soon as the element sits behind a conditional, so JSX at module scope or in a concise arrow body (`() => <View className="dark:..." />`) is a build error naming the fix.

`@hozo/runtime` keeps **one** subscription per app, not one per component, and its snapshot is a coarse value — the breakpoint's name rather than the raw width. A resize that doesn't cross a breakpoint therefore re-renders nothing, and Android's keyboard-driven dimension events never reach it at all, since only width is an input.

## Errors vs. warnings

Error-severity diagnostics stop the build. The case that exists for is a Web-only utility (`block`, `grid`, `h-screen`) reaching the Native backend: there's no correct output, so continuing would ship a layout that looks right on Web and is silently wrong on device.

Everything else is a warning printed during the build.

## Existing React Native and Expo projects

Hozo compiles a file whose primitives come from `react-native`, with no
migration to `@hozo/core`:

```tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

export function Card() {
  return (
    <View className="rounded-xl p-4">
      <Text className="font-bold">Hello</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

The compiler always handled this — it matches on the JSX tag name and never
asks where the name came from, which is what proposal §2.1 promises. What
did not was the gate in front of it: every integration tested
`code.includes('@hozo/core')`, so an Expo project was skipped for not having
been rewritten.

Matching on the tag name is also why the gate cannot simply be widened. A
`<View>` from a third-party component library has its own props and its own
layout, and lowering it to a React Native `View` because the tag is spelled
`View` would replace someone's component with a different one. So a file is
compiled when *every* primitive-named binding in it comes from a module the
project trusts:

```js
withHozo(config, { sources: ['@hozo/core', 'react-native', './src/ui'] })
```

The default is `['@hozo/core', 'react-native']`. A file importing only from
modules outside that list is left alone silently — a project whose own
components are named `View` is not doing anything wrong. A file mixing the
two is left alone *with* a warning, because there its author has every
reason to expect lowering.

## @expo/ui and other component libraries

`@expo/ui` exports `Text`, `Button`, `List`, `ListItem`, `ScrollView` and
`TextInput` — every one a native SwiftUI or Jetpack Compose control that
shares nothing with the Hozo primitive of the same name but its spelling.
A compiler matching on tag names alone cannot tell them apart.

So the module list travels into the compiler and resolution happens **per
tag**. This file compiles:

```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native'
import { Button, Host } from '@expo/ui/swift-ui'

export function Screen() {
  return (
    <View className="p-4">
      <Host><Button label="Save" /></Host>
    </View>
  )
}
```

The `View` lowers and gets its styles; the `<Host><Button/></Host>` is
carried verbatim, the same treatment any component Hozo does not model
already gets. Refusing the whole file would have left the half Hozo
understands uncompiled; accepting it would have turned a SwiftUI button
into a `Pressable`.

Two Native-side guards had to learn the same distinction: a carried
`<Button>` is normally a build error, because Hozo's Button is a semantic
primitive and React Native's takes a `title` and renders no children — but
a carried `@expo/ui` Button is the correct outcome. And the generated
`react-native` import skips any name the file already binds to something
else.
