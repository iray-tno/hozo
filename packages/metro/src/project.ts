// Metro's half of the candidate scan (proposal §7's third tier on Native).
//
// Why this is a separate config-time step, where Vite does it inside the
// plugin: Metro runs `transform` in `jest-worker` subprocesses. Several
// workers transform files concurrently, so scanning and writing from there
// would mean several writers to one cache file. Metro's *config* layer is
// ordinary main-process code, which is where this runs -- one writer, no
// locking needed, exactly the ownership the cache crate assumes.
//
// KNOWN LIMITATION: the candidate module is generated once, at config load.
// A class that only becomes a candidate after Metro started -- a new string
// literal in a helper module -- won't be in the map until Metro is
// restarted. `react-native-css` documents the same restriction for its own
// transformer. The generated module is deliberately written under
// `node_modules/.hozo/`, so a restart with a cleared cache regenerates it.
