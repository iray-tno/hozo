// The webpack/Turbopack loader.
//
// Plain `.js` rather than the `.ts` the rest of this repository is written
// in, because a loader is resolved and executed by the bundler rather than
// imported by a tool that understands TypeScript. `@hozo/storybook`'s
// `preset.js` exists for the same reason.
//
// Asynchronous because the theme is: `loadProjectTheme` reads and runs the
// project's Tailwind entry stylesheet. It caches by root, so the cost is
// paid once per process no matter how many modules pass through here.
