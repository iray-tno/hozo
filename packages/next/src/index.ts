// Next.js integration.
//
// The first non-Vite bundler Hozo runs under, and the shape of the problem
// is genuinely different rather than differently spelled. A Vite plugin has
// lifecycle hooks -- `buildStart` to read the theme and walk the project,
// `watchChange` for deletions, `buildEnd` to persist. Next.js gives a
// config object and a loader, and under Turbopack there is no plugin API at
// all: a loader is the only place user code runs.
//
// So the project-wide half happens here, while `next.config.ts` is being
// evaluated. That is once per build, before anything is compiled, in the
// Next process itself -- which is exactly when a Vite plugin's `buildStart`
// would run. The per-file half is the loader, and it re-scans each module
// it is handed so a class written during `next dev` reaches the candidate
// stylesheet without a restart.
