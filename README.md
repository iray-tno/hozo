# Hozo

> A Rust-powered universal UI compiler and accessibility-first layer for React Native.

**Status: working prototype, not yet published.** The Rust compiler, five
bundler and framework integrations, both lowering backends, the runtime
adapters and the conformance suite are implemented and tested. Public APIs
and package boundaries may still change. See
[docs/proposal.md](docs/proposal.md) for the design document (Japanese).

## What is Hozo

Hozo compiles React Native source toward the platform it actually runs on:

- **Web** — semantic DOM, CSS and ARIA, with a minimal runtime
- **Native** — React Native / Fabric, with a minimal runtime

Applications import canonical primitives from `@hozo/core` (or keep
importing from `react-native`). Hozo lowers those primitives to semantic
DOM and CSS on Web, or to React Native components and `StyleSheet` values
on Native. Existing React Native applications can adopt it incrementally,
though today that means changing imports at the migration boundary.

Hozo is a compilation layer rather than a new component framework. Its Web
output is designed to keep React Native for Web off compiled paths while
preserving React Native's component and event contracts where practical.

Accessibility is a requirement from v1, not an add-on.

## Getting started

> Nothing below is on npm yet. These are the commands the first release
> will carry, and what the examples in this repository already run.

Every integration takes the same options, and the only one most projects
need is `css` — the path to the Tailwind entry stylesheet that defines the
project's design tokens. Left out, Hozo looks for the usual filenames and
falls back to Tailwind's defaults if it finds none. If your tokens live
somewhere it did not guess, say so: a project compiled against the wrong
palette gets wrong numbers and unresolved variables, not an error.

### Vite

```sh
npm install --save-dev @hozo/vite @hozo/compiler
npm install @hozo/core @hozo/runtime
```

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { hozo } from '@hozo/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  // `hozo()` before `react()`: it has to see the original JSX, before
  // the React plugin's transform touches the file.
  plugins: [hozo({ css: 'src/theme.css' }), react()],
})
```

### Next.js

Works with both bundlers — Turbopack (the default from Next 16) and
`next build --webpack`.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @hozo/next @hozo/compiler
npm install @hozo/core @hozo/runtime
```

```ts
// next.config.ts
import { withHozo } from '@hozo/next'

export default withHozo({ /* your Next config */ }, { css: 'src/theme.css' })
```

### Metro (React Native, Expo)

```sh
npm install --save-dev @hozo/metro @hozo/compiler
npm install @hozo/core @hozo/runtime
```

```js
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('@react-native/metro-config')
const { withHozo } = require('@hozo/metro/config')

// Exported as a promise, which Metro awaits: the project-wide candidate
// module has to be generated before the bundle starts.
module.exports = withHozo(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), { css: 'src/theme.css' })
```

### Storybook

Zero configuration beyond the addon — it wraps `@hozo/vite`.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @hozo/storybook
```

```ts
// .storybook/main.ts
export default {
  framework: '@storybook/react-vite',
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.tsx'],
  addons: ['@hozo/storybook'],
}
```

### TanStack Start

The Vite plugin, first in the list:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [hozo({ css: 'src/theme.css' }), tanstackStart(), viteReact(), nitro()],
})
```

## How styles are resolved

Hozo does not treat a dynamic `className` as a single thing to give up on.
There are three tiers, and only the last one costs anything at runtime.

**Static — compiled away.**

```tsx
<View className="p-4 bg-blue-500" />
```

Becomes a scoped class in a real stylesheet. Nothing is left at runtime.

**Structurally dynamic — compiled into a conditional.**

```tsx
<View className={cn('p-4', active && 'bg-blue-500', size === 'lg' && 'text-xl')} />
```

The compiler does not need to know what `active` is. It keeps the shape of
the expression and compiles each branch, so all three classes are real CSS
and the choice between them is a boolean at runtime.

**Truly dynamic — a runtime fallback.**

```tsx
<View className={classNameFromProps} />
```

Here the compiler genuinely cannot tell. Every class *any* source file in
the project mentions is scanned and emitted into one project-wide
stylesheet, so whatever the expression produces is already defined. The
scan is cached and incremental.

The theme behind all of this is read from the project's own Tailwind
entry stylesheet by running Tailwind's resolver, rather than by parsing a
config file — the same discipline the conformance suite uses when it asks
Tailwind for its own class list instead of keeping a copy.

### StyleX frontend (experimental)

Hozo can also read a static same-file StyleX sheet into the same IR. This
works alongside Tailwind on one element and lowers through the ordinary Web
and Native backends:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex'
import { View } from '@hozo/core'

const styles = stylex.create({
  root: { padding: 16, backgroundColor: '#2563eb' },
  active: { opacity: 0.7 },
})

export function Card({ active }: { active: boolean }) {
  return <View className="rounded-xl" {...stylex.props(styles.root, active && styles.active)} />
}
```

The transform order is load-bearing: **Hozo must run before the official
StyleX transform**. Hozo consumes `stylex.props` from the original TSX; the
StyleX pass afterward eliminates the now-unused `stylex.create` definition.
Running StyleX first turns the spread into a second `className`, after which
JSX last-wins semantics have already lost the information needed to combine
the two frontends safely. Vite plugin order should therefore put `hozo()`
before the StyleX plugin; Metro's Hozo wrapper already sends its rewritten
source to the configured Babel transformer afterward.

The first slice accepts a namespace import, a same-file module-scope static
`stylex.create`, static string/number values, and
`stylex.props(styles.base, condition && styles.variant)`. It covers the common
universal layout, spacing, size, colour, opacity, radius and text properties,
including border/outline, text-decoration, blend, pointer and sizing keywords.
Against StyleX 0.19.0's published types that is **116/522 property names
(22.2%)**, or **116/116 (100%)** when the denominator is restricted to names
React Native also publishes. The remaining surface is reported separately as
13 contextual-runtime candidates, 1 optional-adapter candidate, and 392
Web-only names. These are property-name upper bounds: each
property still accepts only the statically safe value subset the shared IR can
represent.
Themes/variables, nested selectors, keyframes, cross-file sheets, `sx`, and
StyleX shorthand/longhand priority overlap are not guessed: the spread is
preserved for StyleX and Hozo emits `STYLEX_NOT_LOWERED`.

## Accessibility

ARIA is the vocabulary. React Native has supported the `role` prop since
0.71, so a single `role="switch"` means the same thing to both backends;
`accessibilityRole` is still accepted and mapped where the two differ
(`header` → `heading`, `search` → `searchbox`, `image` → `img`,
`adjustable` → `slider`).

The role table is generated from
[`aria-query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aria-query) — the machine-readable
ARIA specification that `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` and Testing Library read —
rather than hand-kept, so it cannot quietly drift. With it the compiler can
say more than "that is not a role":

- an abstract role (`role="widget"`) is named as one, not rejected as unknown
- a role used without the states or properties it is meaningless without is
  reported as an incomplete pattern
- a role with no Web equivalent is reported rather than silently dropped

`@hozo/a11y` carries the patterns that need real runtime behaviour — focus
management, keyboard handling — starting with `Dialog`.

## Development

Requires Node 22+, pnpm 11 and a Rust toolchain.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @hozo/compiler build:native   # the Rust addon, once
pnpm build
pnpm test                                   # JS suites + package packing
cargo test --workspace                      # Rust suites
pnpm typecheck
```

The publishing metadata for all nine packages is generated by
`scripts/package-metadata.mjs`; `scripts/check-packages.mjs` re-derives it,
fails on drift, and then looks inside the tarballs `npm pack` would produce
to check every entry point is actually in them.

## What Hozo does not do yet

- **It is not published.** Nothing is on npm; the native addon is built
  locally.
- **Migration is manual.** An existing app adopting Hozo changes its
  imports at the boundary itself; there is no codemod.
- **No physical-device validation.** The Native backend is exercised
  through Metro bundles and `react-test-renderer`, not on a device.
- **The Grid subset is partial**, and the Tailwind surface is wide but not
  complete — `@hozo/tailwind-conformance` reports exactly which utilities
  match the real engine. Its current numbers are committed at
  [packages/tailwind-conformance/snapshot.json](packages/tailwind-conformance/snapshot.json),
  and CI fails if a change moves any of them without moving that file too.
  They are not repeated here: a number copied into prose is a number that
  can drift from the thing it describes.
