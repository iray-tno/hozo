Add `OtpInput`, for a one-time code or a PIN. It is one real input drawn as cells, so a screen reader finds one field ("Verification code, 6 characters"), and a pasted or autofilled code lands at once. It asks each platform for a one-time code: `autocomplete="one-time-code"` on the Web, `textContentType="oneTimeCode"` on iOS and `autoComplete="sms-otp"` on Android. `mask` turns it into a PIN. The active and filled cells are styled by class lists the pattern applies, so the look reaches React Native as well.
