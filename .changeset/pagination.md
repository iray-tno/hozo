Add `Pagination`: numbered pages with previous and next, inside a `<nav>` named "Pagination". The current page is marked with `aria-current="page"` (`selected` on Native), and the ends are disabled in place rather than removed. With `getPageHref` every page is a link, which on Native goes through the installed router. The current page and the disabled ends are styled by class lists the pattern applies (`currentItemClassName`, `disabledItemClassName`), so the same look reaches React Native, where there are no selectors.
