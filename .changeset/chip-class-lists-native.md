`Chip`'s `className` and `removeClassName` now style it on React Native. Before, both were ignored there. The compiler lowers `Chip` from `@hozo/core` to `HozoChip` and hands its two class lists over as `style` and `removeStyle`. On the Web they are compiled to classes as before. The Native pattern moves text styles such as `text-white` onto its label, where a `Text` can draw them.
