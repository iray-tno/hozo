Add `Avatar`: a person's picture, or their initials when it is absent or fails to load, read as one image named for the person, with an optional status read after the name ("Ada Lovelace, online"). The headless version lives in `@hozo/patterns`, and the look (three sizes and a status dot) in `@hozo/ui`. Its class lists compile on both platforms, as `Chip`'s do. `@hozo/core` now also exports `Chip`, which it previously reached only through compiled output.
